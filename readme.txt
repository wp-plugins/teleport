Teleport is all about getting around WordPress quickly! Use keyboard shortcuts to get where you need to go with just two key strokes.

== Description ==

The intuitive teleporter is arranged exactly like the keyboard shortcuts - the e, d, s, a, and q keys make a 'u' shape around the w key. This matches the layout of the teleporter.

= About the Teleporter =

The Teleporter can be activated from anywhere on your site except the admin area(although I'm working on this). To activate, press the "w" key. The Teleporter will appear and display different options depending on whether you're logged in or not. Once the Teleporter has opened, the e, d, s, a, q, and esc shortcuts become available.
